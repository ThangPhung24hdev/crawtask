Deskpro already has a library of apps (some of which are open source here <a href=\"https://github.com/DeskproApps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://github.com/DeskproApps</a> - JIRA, Shopify, Salesforce, etc), and you will deliver even more.</p><p>You will be involved in all aspects of planning, developing, and delivering integrations. You'll deliver new apps, but you'll also help us create frameworks that enable other developers to create apps, and you'll work closely with our product team where you will have input on planning, design decisions, UX, and everything in between.</p><p>You'll be joining a small team where your specific experience will have great impact. You will have a lot of autonomy over your projects and you will get to use your expertise to lead by example.</p><p>Deskpro is a small company, and that means you will sometimes be expected to dip in and out of various roles as needs arise. You will learn a lot through the varied work, and you will get satisfaction in shipping software that gets used by thousands.</p><p></p><p><strong>Technology we use and where we're going</strong><br /></p><p>Most of the Deskpro product backends are written in PHP (Symfony, Laravel) with the primary data store being MySQL. The frontend is Typescript/React (with our own component library) and our primary APIs are GraphQL.</p><p>Integrations are often build atop our <em>apps framework</em>, a ReactJS/Typescript framework that lets us build sandboxed apps that live right inside of Deskpro. But there are deeper kinds of integrations that will require you to implement totally new product features such as PHP backends or APIs.</p><p></p><p><strong>Why should you be interested?</strong></p><ul> <li>You'll get to use and learn about many different products, APIs and technologies. Deskpro is the central hub for a lot of companies, and we're always adding new features and modules and integrations.</li> <li>You'll get to work with real customers and get a peek into how other businesses operate.</li> <li>You'll get to learn about scaling software as well as scaling the SaaS platform as a whole.</li> <li>You'll play a huge part in the overall product lifecycle.</li> </ul><p></p><p><strong>You are a good fit for the role if...</strong></p><ul> <li>You have an earnest interest in developing software with a desire to learn more about the craft.</li> <li>You have a lot of experience with PHP (with Symfony or Laravel) and experience with building SPAs with ReactJS (and ideally TypeScript).</li> <li>You have excellent written and verbal communication skills. We are big believers in \"writing stuff up\", everything from spec's to dev docs to RFC's. You need to be able to know your audience and communicate clearly.</li> <li>You enjoy solving problems yourself and like working in a \"get stuff done\" environment.
